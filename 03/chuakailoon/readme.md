| Industry Talk (Poster)         | 23/11/24         | `The talk from AirAsia was truly engaging, especially when the speakers shared their experiences as software engineers in a major company. I realized that the required skills go beyond technical abilities like programming, data management, and problem-solving; they also include soft skills such as teamwork, adaptability, and effective communication. The assignment further highlighted the challenges software engineers face while working from home, as well as common misconceptions about remote work. Additionally, I found it fascinating how these challenges are tackled through innovative thinking, continuous learning, and cross-team collaboration. Lastly, AirAsia‚Äôs work culture ensures that everyone is treated equally, not only boosting employee morale but also fostering innovation and collective success.`               | [ASSIGNMENT 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RqQaej_miE6Srsi2rT_Fjb4wXIQCVnLT/view?usp=sharing)         |
