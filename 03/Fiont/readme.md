Besides from the tools and software for system development that I familiar to, I still need to learn more and other from that. Other than that, communication and leadership skills are my weakness. Thus, I will keep improving myself to enchance all these skills. I will also focus on my thinking and problem-solving skills.

In summary, I will use it wisely to maximise the benefit it brings to me.                                     |
