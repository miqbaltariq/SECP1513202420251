I have done 4 assignment for technology & information system throughout my first semester.
These are my reflection for the assignments.

## REFLECTION OF MY ASSIGNMENT

| No. | Assignments | Reflections |
|-----|---------------------|--------------------|
|  1  |  PC Assemble  |  The activity which is PC assemble is my first ever task in UTM that needs us to focus and discuss together in the group to assemble the pc from zero. This activity was not only fun but also incredibly rewarding, as it gave me practical insights into how computers are built and how they function. It made me realize the importance of each component and how they contribute to the overall performance of a PC. We were assigned with simple quiz to test our understanding about PC assemble and the components of the PC |
|  2  |  Poster(Industry talk 1) |  The talk from airasia was really captivating especially when they are sharing about their working experiences as software engineer in the big company.  I realized that skills needed not only technical abilities like programming, data management, and problem solving, but also soft skills like teamwork, adaptability, and effective communication. The assignmnet also shed light on the obstacles that software engineeer confront during work from home and the myths about WFH. Moreover, I discovered it exciting how these issues are being addressed through inventive thinking, continual learning, and cross-team collaboration. Lastly, airasia working culture ensure that everyone treated equally to make sure they not only enhance employee morale but also drive innovation and collective success.  |
|  3  |  Video(Industry visit 1 at UTM digital) |  UTM digital visit mainly focusing to show us about the facility, technologies and real world working experiences. The visit showed the application of advanced digital tools, such as big data analytics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, into company processes across several industries. It also highlighted the significance of providing students with the technical and soft skills required to flourish in the quickly changing digital ecosystem. The visit not only broadened my knowledge but also motivated us to enter the digital industry. https://youtu.be/V82A5N3R-yY?si=u4PMZIoTT3tqkHZS  |
|  4  |  Academic writing(Industry talk 2) |  Industry talk given by Encik Mohd Hakimi Iqmall and Encik Nik Mohd Habibullah motivated us through their inspiring sharing session. I also learned the importance of technical and non technical skills in the industry that will helps in the future.  |
|  5  |  Poster(Industry visit 2 at CODE'25)|  The workshop about powerBI during CODE' 25 teach us on how to organized big data and how to visualise the data in report format. PowerBI is not only for the professional, with the user friendly interface makes it accesibble for everyone including non-tech savvy people.  |
|  6  |  Design Thinking(Low fidelity project)  |  We were given two task which is low fidelity project and video demo presentation. My group decide to make a InfiniteProtech application since nowadays a lot of elderly and youngsters keeps getting scammed. Through this project I gain many valuable lessons not only the skills for design thinking but I learned the requirements to make an application like databaase and cloud database, which are essential for supporting a scalable and secure app. Working with my teammates was a valuable experience.We gathered and brought distinct ideas and making the process more collaborative and efficient. To conclude this assignment was a significant way to enhance my journey as a computer science student since we learned technical  and non technical skills along the project period. https://youtu.be/-n2pWXk1pg4 |
