1. Poster (Industry Talk: Overview of ICT Jobs) – 23 NOV 2024

This talk gave me a deeper understanding of the various roles in the tech industry, such as UI/UX Developer, QA Testing Analyst, and Web Developer. I learned how different departments collaborate to ensure smooth project execution. Additionally, I improved my Canva skills while designing the project poster. The talk also inspired me to keep up with the latest tech trends to remain competitive in the job market.

2. Video (Industry Visit: UTM Digital) – 10 DEC 2024

Visiting UTM Digital provided firsthand experience of how a tech organization operates. Observing the workflow across departments helped me understand how different roles contribute to a project's success. This project also introduced me to basic video editing, a skill I can use in future presentations. The visit made me more aware of the professional work environment and how to adapt to it.

3. Report (Industry Talk: Skills in University & Industry) – 17 DEC 2024

This talk highlighted the skills gap between university education and industry expectations, motivating me to develop both technical and soft skills. I also learned valuable insights into the job application process, including resume building and interview techniques. Additionally, I gained experience in writing academic reports, which will be crucial for my thesis in the future.

4. Poster (CODE'25: PowerBI Workshop) – 11 JAN 2025

This workshop introduced me to PowerBI, a powerful data visualization tool. I learned how to transform raw data into meaningful insights using dashboards and reports. As a Data Engineering student, mastering PowerBI is a valuable addition to my skillset. Additionally, designing the project poster helped refine my creative and presentation skills.

5. Design Thinking Project (HashRemote) – 17 JAN 2025 https://youtu.be/SMFT7hZgijk

This project deepened my understanding of the Internet of Things (IoT) by applying theory to a real-world solution. As part of the UI/UX design team, I explored fundamental design principles and user-centered thinking. I also learned the structured approach of design thinking, from empathizing with users to prototyping and testing solutions.
