List of Assignment I did with my incredible teammates: 
| **Assignment**  | **Description**  | **Date**  | **Reflection**  |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **1**     | **Industry Talk: Petronas Digital**      | **23 November 2024**      | **Petronas is the first dream company that I want to work with. By joining this talk, I gained more details about Petronas. For example, now I knew the different role between Software Engineering, Data Engineering and Data Scientists. Before this, I thought these three play same role because their name are quiet same, but turns out it was different! Other than that, as someone who are dreaming to work with them, I love their work environment. This talk also highlights the supportive working culture at Petronas. By having this environment, I believe Petronas provides an excellent platform for employees to thrive, learn, and contribute meaningfully.**      |
| **2**     | **Industry Visit: UTM Digital**      | **10 December 2024**      | **By doing this industry visit, I know how a day as a programmer, their working environment, working teammates and what they do as a programmer. Other than that, I got to try their smart board. It was big and nice ! It is easy to use even to a beginner. This smart board can significantly improve collaboration and communication in meetings. It allows multiple users to interact with the content simultaneously, making brainstorming and idea-sharing more efficient. You can easily display presentations, documents, and diagrams, and instantly make edits or annotations on the board.**      |
| **3**     | **Industry Talk: Skills required to be a good programmer**      | **17 December 2024**      | **The talk was from alumni UTM, which I met him at UTM Digital. He is an information technology officer. By listening his talk, foundation of programming is important. This is because, having a strong foundation in programming helps in understanding complex concepts, improving problem-solving skills, and can easily learn new programming language. Other than that, this talk made me more focus on enhancing my soft skills such as communication. By having great communication skills, I believe it helps me in career growth and leadership.**      |
| **4**     | **Attending WorkShop: PowerBI**     | **17 January 2025**     | **Attending my first Power BI workshop was a great learning experience. I discovered how to connect to data, create visualizations, and build dashboards. At first, it felt a bit overwhelming, but the hands-on practice made it easier to understand. I also learned how important it is to clean and organize data before using it. The workshop showed me how visuals can tell a story and make data easier to understand. Overall, it was a valuable experience, and I’m excited to keep learning and using Power BI in the future.**     |
