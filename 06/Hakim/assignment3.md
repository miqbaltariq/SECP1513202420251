# Reflection

This talk is conducted at 17th December 2024 at BK1, N28, UTM JB. This mainly shares the working experiences of Encik Mohd Hakimi Iqmall and the journey of 
Encik Nik Mohd Habibullah in entreprenuership in IT field.After hearing this talk, I realized that there are many more IT related things that I must learn.
So, I will get expose to these things as much as possible in these 4 years and have more understanding in IT field. Hoping that during my study years, Iâ€™ll get as 
much knowledge in IT field as possible to help me excel in IT field.
