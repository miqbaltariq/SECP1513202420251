# Reflection

After this session, I have learn lots of new compartment in desktop. For example, I can get to see the motherboard and CPU close up, which is new experiences for myself.
After the lab assistants show us how to disassemble the desktop in the right order, then we got the chance to assemble it back in a group. It was so much fun and also gives me
a whole lots of knowledge since the lab assistants also explain the function of each compartment. Last but not least, my group is the first group that manage to assemble back
the desktop correctly.
