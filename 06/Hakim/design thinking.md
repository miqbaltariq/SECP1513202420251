# Reflection

While completing this project, I got to learn the application of Internet of Things (IoT) in real life situation. IoT is a field that keeps advancing from time to time
so this project really help me to understand the current trend of IoT. Implementing IoT in a laundry project has been an enlightening experience, allowing me to explore
the integration of smart technology with traditional laundry operations. By implementing IoT, we were able to come up with a laundry system that have more advantages
compare to the existing laundry system near us.
