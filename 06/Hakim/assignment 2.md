# Reflection
We have visited UTM Digital to see the work environment and get to know better about working in IT field. We get to know number of staff that work in UTM Digital. 
Besides, we also get to see the facilities provided by UTM for the staff working there. 
When we enter the hall, we were given a talk by Encik Muhammad Farid bin Sarji. He told us that there are a total of 170 staffs working in UTMDigital, which shows
how strong the competition is in order to hold a spot in this field. He also told us about the information about our WiFi network in UTM.
After the talk, we visit the facilities in UTMDigital. We also get the chance to interview some of the staff there about their working experiences and answer some of
our questions. We do record the process of our visit, and we make it into a video.
