# Reflection

On 10 January 2025, our group HashTech attended an OSINT workshop conducted by CyberX and Persaka. This insightful session provided a comprehensive 
understanding of OSINT, its methodologies and role in cybersecurity. The talk was given by members of CyberX that have the experiences practicing OSINT.
After the talk, they give us some time to try it, then they make a competition for us to compete with each other. inclusion of a mini OSINT CTF at the end
added a competitive and fun element, allowing participants to gain hands-on experience.In addition, the organizers were highly efficient well prepared, 
ensuring the workshop was both informative and enjoyable.
