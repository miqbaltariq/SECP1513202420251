# Welcome to my e-portfolio!

Hello! My name is Rayan Baha Eldin Elkhir Elawad, and I am a first-year Computer Science student specializing in Network and Security at the University of Technology Malaysia (UTM). 
This is my reflection on the assignments and activities throughout the semester.




|                |                         |                         
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|PC Assembly | I Learned about the components of the CPU, its internal structure, the exact location if each part, and its function.            |          
|Assignmet 1       |I learned about PETRONAS YGP is a training program for recent graduates that includes hands-on training, mentoring, leadership skill development, and engagement in digital projects. It offers opportunities in software engineering, data engineering, and data science, with a focus on technology and innovation.            |           
|Assignment 2         |During our visit to UTM Digital, I learned about their excellent and secure services, how the systems work, and how they help university members streamline and speed up various processes, for example transportation and administrative procedures.|
|Assignment 3  | In Assignment 3, I learned about the essential skills required for computer science students, such as programming, mathematics, design, and more. I also learned about the importance of communication skills needed in their professional environment.
|Assignment 4 | From the workshop, I have learned about the importance of security in general, as well as some methods of security breaches. I hope to be one of those who contribute to increasing the level of security in the coming years insha Allah.
|Project Thinking Design  | In the final project, "Bus Tracking Real System," I learned about the websites and apps connected to the university buses that use GPS to track and determine the arrival time of each bus. This system provides real-time updates, making it easier for users to plan their commute efficiently. It's a very useful and practical system that enhances the overall transportation experience at the university.
