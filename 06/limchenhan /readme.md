|--------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
|PC Assemble|          |The PC assemble and reassemble lab activity allows students to interact with the computer hardware. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to assemble and reassemble a real PC since hardware components are important in Network and Security field. Through the hands-on activity, I have benefited greatly as it enhanced my understanding of the correct PC installation flow and the actual hardware placement in the PC. The formation of a small group for this practical work also allows me and team mates to work together in handling the PC installation and share knowledge regarding the functions of the productivity tools and the hardware components.|
|Assignment 1 (Poster on Industry Talk 1)  |          |For Assignment 1, me and my teammates are required to create a poster based on the industry talk video given, which is EY Technology Consulting. Through the talk, I was well informed about the role of the company, departments in the company that provide several specific services and their working culture. Sharing sessions by the presenters about their career journey in EY made me understand that not only technical work such as coding is needed in an ICT company but also the management work of the projects. I also learned that basic skills, communication skills and attitude are the most important qualities to work in EY or any other ICT companies. By completing this assignment, I am able to explore more on the poster creating software, Canva and become more familiar with it.|
|Assignment 2 (Video on Industry Visit 1) |          |In this assignment, me and my team members need to prepare a vlog video on our visit to UTMDigital. I would like to express my thanks to Dr. Iqbal for arranging a meaningful and informative industry visit to UTMDigital. Another special thanks to all the UTMDigital staffs for accompany us and provides detailed explanation regarding their services during the visit. Through the visit to UTMDigital, I am able to see and experience the real working environment of the industry and gain information on the digital service and solutions they provide. I realized that UTMDigital plays an important role in both academic and management system of UTM. Without the digital solutions, the operation of the university would not run fast and smoothly. By working on this assignment, I am able to improve my video editing skills using CapCut as all team members contributed their idea on the design and the flow of the video.|
|Assignment 3 (Academic Writing)|           |For Assignment 3, we are required to prepare an academic writing based on the Industrial Talk 2 video. After watching the video, I am convinced that both technical skills and management skills are essential in order to success in IT industry. However, these skills are not skills that we can master it in a short time. Therefore, I should prepare myself with these hard and soft skills during university so that these skills will be enhanced when I am in the industry later. I also gained a clear overview regarding the job application flow so that to increase the job opportunities and reduce risk of applying the wrong job. By preparing the academic writing, I have learnt to design a suitable structure for the report and write in an academic style which is more proper and formal.|
|Assignment 4 (Poster on CODE’25 Workshop)|          |For the last group assignment, we are required to attend at least one workshop conducted by CODE’25 and create one poster based on the selected workshop. Me and my team members chose to attend the OSINT workshop and it was an exciting and memorable experience. From the workshop, I am exposed to the OSINT tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities using publicly available info. Although it was my first time using these OSINT tools, but with the step-by-step guidance by the presenter, I was able to grasp some knowledge and use the tools. The mini CTF challenge conducted at the end of the workshop were enjoyable and allows me to gain hands on experience. By completing this assignment, I was able to convert information learnt from this workshop, to a poster that consists of text and graphics.|
|Design Thinking Project|          |In this design thinking project, we need to come up with an idea and create a prototype based on the given theme. Our group theme is Internet of Things (IoT) and we have decided to come up with an IoT-based laundry system after a discussion. Throughout the project, I have a deeper understanding about the design thinking process, from identifying the problems and needs, verifying competitors to the prototyping phase. These phases are necessary to ensure our system are relevant and meets the client’s requirements. I also realized that teamwork is important in this project. With the cooperation and contribution of the group members, the project has completed successfully. Therefore, I want to thank all the group members for being responsible and supportive throughout this design thinking project.|
