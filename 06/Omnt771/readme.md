# Hello and welcome my friend to my e-Portfolio!

My name is MOMEN ELGASIM MOHAMED SEED AHMED (A24CS0021), and this is my e-portfolio where you can find my assignments and assessments of TIS (SECP1513). 

This subject has been a fun experience from building PCs to making videos of my team's proposal. It was an exciting journey

|PC Assemble               |I've always wondered how a PC is built and how the parts are organized inside a computer but I never got the chance to build or look inside one, but in this subject, I got the chance to do so and I am pleased I did so, I even assembled the PC the fastest! It was super fun. |
|Assignment 1 (Industry Talk Poster)             |The industry talk by AirAsia was truly insightful. They provided an excellent session on how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Computer Science (CS) play a crucial role in helping multi-national companies grow beyond expectations. One of the key takeaways was the significance of communication, especially in large organizations. Effective communication not only bridges cultural and operational differences but also fosters a collaborative and cohesive work environment. |
|Assignment 2 (Industrial Visit Video)               |Our industrial visit to UTM was an eye-opening experience. We had the opportunity to explore advanced research facilities and witness how cutting-edge technology is applied in real-world scenarios. The visit provided valuable insights into various engineering and computing innovations, emphasizing the importance of research and development in shaping the future. Additionally, interacting with professionals and researchers at UTM highlighted the significance of teamwork, problem-solving, and continuous learning in the industry. This experience truly broadened our understanding of how academic knowledge is transformed into impactful solutions..|
|Assignment 3 (Academic Writing)             |Hearing a former UTM student's journey was inspiring and gave me valuable insights into industry challenges and growth opportunities. It motivated me to stay focused, work harder, and learn from experienced professionals. Iâ€™m now encouraged to join more tech-related activities and stay open to continuous learning.|
|Assignment 4 (Poster on CODE'25)             |The Bioinformatics Unbound workshop has opened my eyes to a completely new field. I learned how biological research can be enhanced through computational tools and data analysis, which was something I never thought was possible. The experience was inspiring and made me curious about how technology can drive advancements in areas like healthcare, genetics, and scientific discovery.|
