# Hello and welcome my friend to my e-Portfolio!

My name is Abdelrahman Elfatih Abdelrahman (A23CS4032), and this is my e-portfolio where you can find my assignments and assessments of TIS (SECP1513). 

This subject has been a fun experience from building PCs to making videos of my team's proposal. It was an exciting journey

## Assesment reflection!

|PC Assemble               |I've always wondered how a PC is built and how the parts are organized inside a computer but I never got the chance to build or look inside one, but in this subject, I got the chance to do so and I am pleased I did so, I even assembled the PC the fastest! It was super fun. |
|Assignment 1 (Industry Talk Poster)             |The industry talk was really interesting, AirAsia gave us a very amazing talk and taught us how ICT and CS help them and other multi-national companies scale beyond imagination, I also learned how communication is a very important skill, especially in big companies, it helps them bridge the cultural and operational challenges and helps them build a strong and understanding community. |
|Assignment 2 (Industrial Visit Video)               |For Assignment 2, it's quite unfortunate for me that I couldn't make it. I had a midterm, and I couldn't attend the industry visit because it clashed with my exam. I'm really sad that I missed it because many of my friends who went said it was really fun.|
|Assignment 3 (Academic Writing)             |Hearing a former UTM student's journey was inspiring and gave me valuable insights into industry challenges and growth opportunities. It motivated me to stay focused, work harder, and learn from experienced professionals. Iâ€™m now encouraged to join more tech-related activities and stay open to continuous learning.|
|Assignment 4 (Poster on CODE'25)             |The Bioinformatics Unbound workshop has opened my eyes to a completely new field. I learned how biological research can be enhanced through computational tools and data analysis, which was something I never thought was possible. The experience was inspiring and made me curious about how technology can drive advancements in areas like healthcare, genetics, and scientific discovery.|
