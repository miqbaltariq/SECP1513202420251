|PC Assemble               |I've always wondered how a PC is built and how the parts are organized inside a computer but I never got the chance to build or look inside one, but in this subject, I got the chance to do so and I am pleased I did so, I even assembled the PC the fastest! It was super fun. |
|Assignment 1 (Industry Talk Poster)             |The industry talk by AirAsia was truly insightful. They provided an excellent session on how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Computer Science (CS) play a crucial role in helping multi-national companies grow beyond expectations. One of the key takeaways was the significance of communication, especially in large organizations. Effective communication not only bridges cultural and operational differences but also fosters a collaborative and cohesive work environment. |
