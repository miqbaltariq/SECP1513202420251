Assembling a PC was a valuable hands-on experience that deepened my understanding of each componentâ€™s role.
I learned how the CPU, motherboard, and RAM function together to ensure efficiency. Paying attention to detail is crucial, as small mistakes can prevent the PC from running and cause errors.
This process also strengthened my patience and problem-solving skills when our PC failed to start, but we quickly identified and resolved the issue without complications.
