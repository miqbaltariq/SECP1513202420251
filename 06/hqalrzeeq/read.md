REFLECTION FOR MY ASSIGNMENT AND PROJECT
- ASSIGNMENT 1
  
  The talk really made me aware of the world of ICT. The PETRONAS programme give me a lot of benefit for me, i gained a lot of knowledge        through this industry talk. The talk deepened my understanding about the complexities of adaptability in a rapidly changing world.     Additionally, it made me realize that the job scope about IT is more wider and the i should not scared about not having a job after graduation. At last, through this poster it really help me in increase my soft skill which is technical skill, communication skill, editing skill and more.

- ASSIGNMENT 2

  From the visit and talk from UTM Digital, i get to know a lot of thing that really related to my course. Due to the talk, i get to know about the relation within UTM and Microsoft industry which is can be access if we are using our UTM email. After that, we had a tour inside the UTM Digital we meet a lot of people that work there and know about their role and the importance of their role. They told us about how the website work, how they manage their currency and how the keep secured their web which is the UTM data. Throughout the video that we record, we get to know that our course is really tough and difficult.

- ASSIGNMENT 3

  For this task, it required us to do an academic writing from industrial talk 2. After Encik Nik Habibullah give his word, i realized that before doing something, it required us to have a planning before doing that. For example, before graduate you need to do a deeper exploration about you job scope and what the main skill that required on that job. He also ask us to stay active in any activity college whether it is inside or outside the college in order to strengthen our soft skill, communication skill, technical skill and thinking skill. And he acknowledge us not to giving up at this level, because outside UTM is more challenging than you expected. And i know that i have a lot of skill that still not appeared, and i know i can take advantage from that.

- ASSIGNMENT 4

  Through this workshop meet, i gained a lot of knowledge and experience. The facilitator, the speaker and all the people inside the workshop is really knowledgeable and made the talk fun and exciting. It also help me in deepened my thinking about the world of digital. This workshop not only press us about knowledge, it encourage to work in group since it ask us to do a poster.

- PROJECT DESIGN THINKING

  Working as a group in doing our project which is AR Navigator System (ARNAVI) for the Faculty of Computing for the visitor, new student, student, staff and more. We know the faculty is really big and take time to know all twist and turn about the building. So, we doing this project in order to made people's more lighter in finding the destination or information. All the group member give a good opportunity since we are doing it almost last minute and it is done succesfully without any problem. This project really help me boost out my critical thinking because it is possible that we could use that outside the UTM in the future.

- PC ASSEMBLE

  This activity is the most exciting that i ever do in my life. It really made me experience in assemble and disassemble a lot of component in that thing. My group member also being very supportive and good in doing that activities. Each one of group member giving their role in telling about the use of that component, why it is connect, what is the function and so on. It also strengthen my memorizing skill because it really difficult to assemble a lot of wired and you need to connected it to get the computer turn on. In my opinion, this is the best thing, fun thing, that i have experienced in my life.
