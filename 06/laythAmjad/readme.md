Reflection 

Our group project was a great opportunity for us to come together and share our ideas to reach a common goal. By communicating openly and supporting one another, we were able to divide the tasks effectively and keep each other on track. This experience not only helped us improve our project management skills but also brought us closer as a team.

I was amazed from the beggining and excited to work with a group because working with a group and visiting some places like UTMDIGITAL makes me develop in everything on how to communicate etc. My group TECH DEBUGGERS  talk was a very eye-opening experince that helps me to gain the knowledge on the ICT JOBS for example on AIRASIA on how the flexibilty work arrangements like work from home offer employees more control over their collaboration through digitalschedules and enhance tools, enabling seamless tools, enabling seamless. WE was  friendly and we everyone there their ideas, that makes a person how to develop himself I was so happy because that I can share my ideas and help my temmates to complete our task. 

[2] Assignment 2- INDUSTRIAL VISIT TO UTMDIGITAL 

This industrial visit  made me talk to specialists about how to develop ourselves and our attitude towards the labor marketit. By the way it was a nice visit to UTMDIGITAL and we got a nice experience there. It was my first time to visit like this place and it was so nice we worked with the group to make some discussion on how the the Network is secure and the website and I have learned from my group how to communicate with people and get some skills, we asked some people where  they worked there and they was friendly with us and hope in the future make another visit to UTMDIGITAL.

[3] Assignment 3- ACADEMIC WRITING 

This project taught me the importance of technical skills, communication, and career planning in the IT field. I realized that self-assessment and proactive efforts like networking and participating in activities are crucial for personal and professional growth. The IRPA method gave me a structured way to reflect on my strengths and plan my career path effectively. Also I learned that it’s important to research companies before applying to make sure their values match my goals. This encourages me to improve how I apply for jobs by updating my resume to fit better.

[4] Assignment 4- POSTER ON CODE ROUTE WORKSHOP 

 BackgroundOne of the hands-on workshops held in the Follow-up to the CODE'23 Cyber Security Conference was the CODE'25 Workshop, which focused specifically on Open-Source Intelligence (aka OSINT). The hiring of Sherlock and BreachDirectory, as well as the Wayback Machine, shows how data can be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities and notes the importance of proactive analysis. This hands-on approach connected the dots between OSINT and network and software security, reinforcing the relevance to what we had learned in class and how we can apply it when we advance in our careers. It inspired us to dig deeper into cybersecurity and also incorporate OSINT methods in our career.

[5] Design Thinking- SAFE LINK CHECKER

 I realize how much I’ve grown both personally and as part of a team. The collaboration taught me the value of communication and the importance of leveraging each team member's strengths. I also learned that overcoming challenges together can strengthen our bond and enhance our problem-solving skills. Our temmate used what we learned to find problems, the TTGO  App gave me a valuable view for my problems and how to develop my self I'm not talking only for the app but about the idea of working with a group this make me develop my experience on cybersecurity future. Overall, this experience has inspired me to embrace teamwork in future projects and appreciate the diverse perspectives that each member brings.

Overview on this project that makes me so happy to have built internal and external relationships and benefited a lot from this wonderful project.
