# Reflection

This project is quite a hassle.
I would say it is because we need to find a client and solve the problem related to our topic which is cybersecurity.
Fortunately, We were able to find someone.
Thus come the idea to create Safety Link Checker.
The project really improve my skills, both soft skills and hard skills.
Though I really hope we can make a real product next time.
It will be fun!
