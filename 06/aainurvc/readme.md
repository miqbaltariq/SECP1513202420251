|------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|   1  |   `PC ASSEMBLE`            |This was our first group activity for the semester and I was a bit nervous at first because I feared I might break something inside the CPU. However, the task of reassembling and assembling the computer components turned out to be a great learning experience. We decided to divide the tasks evenly, which helped everything run smoothly. At the end, we needed to turn the CPU on to make sure we had assembled it correctly and we did! It was such a rewarding moment. Working together in a team and successfully completing the assembly not only boosted my confidence but also taught me the importance of clear communication and cooperation in technical tasks. It was interesting and fun to see everything come together.                     |
|   2  |  Assignment      1            |For this assignment, we created a poster about the industrial talk on "A Day in My Life as a Software Engineer at AirAsia." Learning how AirAsia has transformed from a low-cost airline to a digital platform offering services like e-commerce, logistics and financial solutions was truly eye-opening. The talk made me realize how innovation is key to their success and it got me excited about the idea of interning there. The benefits they shared during the talk were incredibly motivating and I was kind of tempted to pursue an internship with them to explore the opportunities for growth and development in the tech field.(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DCotPpPV1RhHZTYrY81guPuFa2WGE3Nv/edit)                         |
|   3  | Assignment       2            |This assignment, which involved an industrial visit to the UTM Digital Building, was one of my favorites because it was such an interactive and hands-on experience. Seeing the UTM Digital and UTMwifi systems in action was super insightful. It gave me a firsthand look at the technology infrastructure that supports the university‚Äôs digital services and it really sparked my interest in the behind-the-scenes tech that powers these systems. The visit was a great opportunity for real-world exposure and it made me appreciate how digital systems are implemented in big institutions.(https://drive.google.com/file/d/16e-4s8oS3m-T83Bf8ghRgzRGtLzlEAS2/view)                           |
|   4  | Assignment       3            |The industrial talk on "Skills in University and Industry" was a great reminder of how essential both technical and soft skills are in the tech industry. From the talk, I‚Äôve become more determined to enhance my soft skills and gain more practical experience through projects and programs. The discussion also made me realize that in Computer Science, it‚Äôs not just about technical knowledge but also the ability to collaborate, manage projects and stay engaged in continuous learning. This has motivated me to focus on developing my programming, problem-solving and teamwork skills to be more effective in the tech field.(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMT07NivcCbTrPqfNlBShksVBV3iKad5/view)|
|   5  | Assignment       4            |The Bioinformatics Unbound workshop was an insightful experience. I was fascinated by how AI and machine learning are being used to address complex challenges in bioinformatics. The discussion on how technologies like Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) are transforming fields such as medicine was particularly inspiring. It made me realize the potential of these innovations in improving healthcare and other industries. The workshop sparked my interest in exploring how advanced technologies can be used to solve real-world problems and pushed me to think more creatively about the impact of emerging tech.

|   6  | Design Thinking Skill: FraudFlex          |Our design thinking project focused on creating a solution for detecting fake online payment receipts, which directly addressed a common issue faced by businesses today. After speaking with a mini market owner about the challenges of verifying receipts, it became clear that businesses need a more efficient and accurate way to handle fraudulent payments. Designing a system that uses OCR, image forensics and machine learning to automatically detect fake receipts was an exciting challenge. This project allowed me to apply technical skills in a practical way and consider how technology can be used to solve real-world problems. The experience deepened my understanding of how innovative solutions can streamline business operations and improve security.
